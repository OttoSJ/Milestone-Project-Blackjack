How To Play Blackjack, In 4 Easy Steps
Yes, when it comes to blackjack strategy, there are loads of rules to learn. But for now, here’s your basic guide of how to play blackjack:

Your goal in blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21.
You’ll receive 2 cards at the beginning of each round, and you’ll add up the values of these cards.
Cards 2-10 have face value; King, Queen, Jack are worth 10; and Aces are either a 1 or an 11 — it’s up to you to decide.
The dealer also draws two cards. The aim of the game is to beat his hand (have a higher hand) without going over 21.
If you would like the dealer to deal you another card, you press “hit-me”
If you do not want to be dealt another card, you press “hold”
“Busting” is when the sum of your hand is over 21.
The winner of the round is whoever has the highest hand without going bust.

- STARTING THE GAME

  To start the game press the "Deal" button. Once the Deal button is pressed both you and the dealer will be dealt two cards each. Both the dealer and your hand total will be displayed on the screen at this time and will remain on the screen throughout the the current hand.

  - AFTER THE GAME HAD STARTED

    Once the intial hand is dealt two buttons will appear on the screen, a "Hold button and a "Hit Me" button. If the dealer's hand is at or over 16 the dealer will hold and not request another card for the remainder of the current hand. In order for the player to request another card, press the "Hit Me" button. The player can press the "Hit Me" button as many times as they wish as long as the players hand total is at or under 21. Once the players hand total is over 21 the current hand is over and the player loses. If the player is satisfied with their current hand total and wishes to remain at that total, the player can press the "Hold" button.

  - ONCE THE HOLD BUTTON IS PRESSED

    Once the hold button is pressed the "Hit Me" button is disabled and the player can no longer request another card for the remainder of the current hand.
    If the dealer has 16 or more once the "Hold" button is pressed then the dealer will not request another card for itself. If the player's hand total is more then the dealer at this point then the player wins the hand. If the dealer has less then the 16 when the hold button is pressed then the dealer will continue to request cards and add to their total until they are equal to, have more then or go over 21 ("Bust").

  - ONCE THE HAND IS OVER AND THE WINNER IS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN

    Once the hand is over and the screen displays the winner, press the "Play Again" button and the next hand will began with the "Deal" button displayed again.

- ENJOY THE GAME!!!
